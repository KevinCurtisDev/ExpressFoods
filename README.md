# Express Foods
For this project, the 4th openclassrooms front end bachelor diploma project, I have been recruited by a fictional young startup called ExpressFood. ExpressFood delivers their own high-quality meals to residences in less than 20 minutes with their team of delivery bikers. 

### Project brief
Every day, ExpressFood creates 2 main dishes and 2 desserts at its headquarters with the help of its experienced chefs. These 2 main dishes are stored in a cold setting and then given to delivery people who bike to the food to the residence that requested it...in less than 20 minutes! 

On its website, ExpressFood allows clients to order one or multiple dishes and desserts. There are no fees for delivery. Menu items change every day. 

Once a client submits their order, they see a page displaying if the order has gone out for delivery yet, as well as an estimate for their meal's arrival time.

ExpressFood needs me to make a database for them that contains the following: 

A list of clients

A list of the different daily menu items

A list of delivery people

An order history for each client

I also have to create a UML diagram to model this technical architecture, and then create the MySQL database and fill it up with fictional information.


### User stories: 
As a restaurant owner, I want to...

* ..be able to see the restaurant menu.
* ..see what customers have ordered.
* ..see customer's previous orders.
* ..see the delivery driver details.

As a delivery driver, I want to...

* ..see the contact details for th ecustomer.
* ..see the customer address.
* ..see the customer order.


## Features
This project features a UML diagram consisting of a number of classes with constraints applied. THe UML diagram was used to build a functional mySQL database.


## Technologies used

* UML
* phpMyAdmin
* MAMP


## Testing

Manual ytesting was carried out on the database in order to confirm that the various tables were properly connected and displayed the correct details and had the proper constraints in place.


## Deployment

THe project was deployed using phpMyAdmin. The database mySQL can be downloaded and executed on a local phpMyAdmin server.


## Difficulties

I hadn't used UML in the past so took a while to get to grips with it. I also had an initial struggle with setting up the correct constraints but once I learned about indexing it was much easier.

## Further enhancements

As a future project I would like to create a front end in order to dynamically display the database information.
